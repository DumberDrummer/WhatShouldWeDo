# What Should We Do?
## Why would you do this?
My wife and I (or maybe just I) struggle to remember all of the little things we want to do together (even if its just figuring out what to watch on netflix), so I built this Rube Goldberg machine to let us input and save activities or content as we think of them. When we're ready to spend some time together, we can get a chip-filtered list in random order of potential activities.

If someone doesn't like a suggestion, it can be vetoed by either party. This makes it a standing list of things we'd both like to do, and we can't lose it. Handy!
